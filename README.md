- 👋 Hi, I’m @jpibar
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematical physics simulation algorithm describing non-linear dynamics with minimization constraints
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to convert code written in Borlan , C++ and Pascal in the 90s so I can add more options to the simulation algorith and correct some bugs in the existing versions I have 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on these updates with an individual versed in these old codes and capable of writing interfaces to make the codes work on modern PC and adapt the outputs to present screens, windows environment and Excel
